## âœ… How to run deobfuscator
If you want to use this deobfuscator, you need to start it from your IDE manually.

2. Make sure that you have selected [Java 17 (Temurin)](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17) in `Project Structure` -> `SDK`
3. Place your obfuscated jar inside the root project directory. For example in `work/obf-test.jar`
4. Navigate to class [`Bootstrap.java`](./deobfuscator-impl/src/test/java/Bootstrap.java)
5. In this class edit the deobfuscator configuration
    - `inputJar` - Your obfuscated jar file that you placed in step 1
    - `transformers` - Pick transformers that you want to run. You can find them in [`deobfuscator-transformers`](./deobfuscator-transformers/src/main/java/uwu/narumi/deobfuscator/core/other) module.
