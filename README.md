## âœ… How to run deobfuscator
If you want to use this deobfuscator, you need to start it from your IDE manually.

1. Clone this repository and open it in IntelliJ
2. (Windows) Open cmd as administrator and run `git config --system core.longpaths true` to enable long paths support
3. Make sure that you have selected [Java 17 (Temurin)](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17) in `Project Structure` -> `SDK`
4. Place your obfuscated jar inside the root project directory. For example in `work/obf-test.jar`
5. Navigate to class [`Bootstrap.java`](./deobfuscator-impl/src/test/java/Bootstrap.java)
6. In this class edit the deobfuscator configuration
    - `inputJar` - Your obfuscated jar file that you placed in step 1
    - `transformers` - Pick transformers that you want to run. You can find them in [`deobfuscator-transformers`](./deobfuscator-transformers/src/main/java/uwu/narumi/deobfuscator/core/other) module.
7. Run this class manually from your IDE. You can use our pre-configured IntelliJ task named `Bootstrap`.

## Attention

### Change the too long class file name

Class files with long file names generated by obfuscator should not be directly submitted to Git, as this will cause Git to display the file as too long.

Modifying the class file name will not have any impact on processing ClassNodes, but a file name that is too long can cause git pull failures.
